### ⚠️ Draft

Can ideas be transferred more efficiently than using a natural language?

Should we talk about complex systems (math, physics, chemistry, biology) and their processes (highly structured information) using natural languages (low structure)?

Creating a constraint (going from a natural language to a special language) might increase clarity. This already happened in mathematics with symbolics and equations.

Having a structured description of a process will allow less painful transfer to interactive models. In case of the natural language a completely separate program has to be developed. Interactivity helps to learn: http://distill.pub/about/, http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/, https://scratch.mit.edu/.

Programming languages are good at: abstractions, collections, dependencies and connections.

[Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) based his object oriented programming ideas on biological cells:

[I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages (so messaging came at the very beginning -- it took a while to see how to do messaging in a programming language efficiently enough to be useful).](http://www.purl.org/stefan_ram/pub/doc_kay_oop_en)

Can we explain basic molecular biology using a programming language?

This repository is a draft example aimed to encode some basic biology principles using one of the most popular web language - JavaScript. This code is not meant to be run and far from finished.

Start code exploration from `index.js`. Hint: it is easier to explore code dependencies on GitHub with [OctoLinker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octolinker/jlmafbaeoofdegohdhinkhilhclaklkp).
